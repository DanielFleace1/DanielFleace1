About me:
- 
Have been teaching myself software development full time starting late  2021. Started with [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and moved on to [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) as my first two learning resources. After completing the first 4 sections of FSO (see FullStackOpen repos), I took time off from the course to make my own MERN App (see habitTracker repos). I am currently working with Chingui Voyage 37 on my first collaborative project. Each week I dedicate some time improve my CS fundamentals with Harvard CS50 and a data structures and algorithms course. I've spent a little bit of time exploring the block chain space and have a basic understanding of block chain fundamentals, solidity , and smart contracts.
