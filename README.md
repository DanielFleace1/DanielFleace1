About me:
- 
Have been teaching myself software development full time starting in late 2021. Started with [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and moved on to [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) as my first two learning resources. After completing the first 3 sections of FSO (see FullStackOpen repos), I took time off from the course to make my own MERN App (see habitTracker repos). I am currently working on building personal projects to improve my development skills. Each week I dedicate some time improve my CS fundamentals, currently following a  data structures and algorithms course. I've spent a little bit of time exploring the block chain space and have a basic understanding of block chain fundamentals, solidity , and smart contracts.
